Unit test patterns
Sean Bennett

In order to compile:

* Install nuget command line and add it to the path (http://nuget.org)
* Install ruby (or iron ruby) and add it to the path (http://rubyinstaller.org)
* From a CMD window run: gem install rake bundler
* Then run: rake (should build)
* Then rune: rake setup:dep (should download all the nuget dependencies)
* Then run: rake test (should run all the tests)
* Then run: rake test:acceptance (should run all features)

This contains a series of snippets for common unit testing scenarios
